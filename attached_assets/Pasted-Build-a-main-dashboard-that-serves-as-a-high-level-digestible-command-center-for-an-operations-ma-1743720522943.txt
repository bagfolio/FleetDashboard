Build a main dashboard that serves as a high-level, digestible “command center” for an operations manager. This dashboard should summarize all critical insights driven by our AI (route efficiency, fuel/time savings, citizen engagement, recycling marketplace activity, and carbon credits) without duplicating the detailed module pages already linked on the left sidebar. Use a clean, modern design with a white background and green accent colors.

1. Overall Layout & Structure
Grid Layout:

Use a responsive 12-column grid (via CSS Grid or Flexbox) for consistent spacing and alignment.

Ensure responsiveness so that the layout adjusts on mobile (stack panels vertically) and on desktop (panels side-by-side).

Header (Top Bar):

Height: 60–80px.

Content:

Left: Display your logo.

Center: Show current date/time.

Right: Display a user profile icon.

Style: Minimalistic, with white background (#FFFFFF) and subtle bottom border (light grey, e.g., #F0F0F0).

Main Content Area:

Divide this into two primary panels:

Left Panel (≈70% width):

This panel will feature a large interactive trend chart that shows key operational metrics over time.

Dimensions: Approximately 600–800px wide on a typical desktop.

Right Panel (≈30% width):

This panel will contain a vertical stack of “Insight/Alert Cards” that display actionable notifications (e.g., alerts for missed pickups, recommended route adjustments).

Each card should be around 200–250px in height.

Spacing:

Use consistent margins/padding (20–30px) between panels and within panels.

Maintain ample white space for clarity.

2. Visual Design & Color Scheme
Color Palette:

Background: White (#FFFFFF) or very light gray (#F8F9FA) for the main background.

Primary Accent: Use green as the main accent color (e.g., #28A745) for buttons, chart lines, and key highlights.

Secondary Colors: Use complementary muted tones (light grays, soft greens) for secondary information.

Alerts: Use red (#DC3545) for critical alerts and orange (#FFC107) for warnings.

Typography:

Font: Use a clean sans-serif font (e.g., Roboto, Open Sans, or Helvetica).

Headers: 24–32px, bold.

Body Text: 14–16px regular.

Labels/Small Info: 12px.

Buttons & Interactive Elements:

Style buttons with a flat design, rounded corners (4–8px radius), and a subtle hover effect (e.g., slight darkening).

Use vector icons (e.g., Font Awesome or Material Icons) sized uniformly (16–24px).

Depth & Shadows:

Apply soft drop shadows to cards and panels (e.g., rgba(0,0,0,0.1) with 2px offset, 5px blur) for subtle depth.

3. Detailed Components
A. Central Trend Chart (Left Panel):

Purpose: Display key trends over time (e.g., “Distance Saved,” “Fuel Savings,” “Time Efficiency”).

Chart Type:

Use a multi-line or area chart.

Interactivity:

Enable tooltips that display detailed values when hovering.

Allow zoom and pan functionality for selecting specific time periods (e.g., last 7 days, last 30 days).

Data Series:

At least three metrics to be plotted concurrently.

Implementation Tips:

Use libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or Recharts.

Set the chart dimensions to fill most of the left panel.

B. Insights/Alerts Cards (Right Panel):

Purpose: Show actionable alerts, notifications, and recommendations.

Card Details:

Size: Approximately 200–250px in height each.

Content:

Header with a small icon (use green accent for positive alerts, red/orange for warnings).

Brief text (e.g., “3 Routes Behind Schedule” or “Missed Pickup in District 4”).

Optionally, a “Read More” link or an expand/collapse action to see more details.

Styling:

Cards should have a white background with a slight shadow to give depth.

Consistent padding (16–20px) inside each card.

Interactivity:

Make cards clickable to navigate to detailed views or pop up more info.

C. (Optional) Summary KPI Row:

If desired, include a slim row of KPI cards just below the header for high-level metrics (e.g., Total Fuel Savings, Cost Savings, CO₂ Emissions Reduced).

Size: Each KPI card approx. 200px wide by 100px high.

Design: Minimal icons, bold numbers, and concise labels.

This row is optional if you feel that the central trend chart and insight cards sufficiently capture high-level data.

4. Data Integration & Interactivity
Placeholder Data:

Initially populate the trend chart with sample data so the interactive features (tooltips, zoom) are demonstrable.

Use sample alerts in the insight cards to show how real-time notifications will appear.

Real-Time Updates:

Set up JavaScript hooks (or WebSocket connections if available later) to update the dashboard dynamically.

Interactivity Testing:

Ensure that hover effects on the trend chart display detailed information.

Verify that clicking on an insight card either expands it or navigates to a more detailed view.

5. Responsiveness & User Experience
Responsive Design:

Use CSS media queries to ensure that on smaller screens (e.g., tablets, mobiles) the left and right panels stack vertically.

Maintain legibility and interactivity on touch devices.

User Experience:

Keep the design clean and uncluttered.

Ensure that all interactive elements (charts, cards, buttons) have smooth transitions and clear hover/click feedback.

Test the dashboard layout across different browsers for compatibility.

6. Coding & Organization
Code Structure:

Organize your code with separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Use comments liberally to explain sections and functions.

If using a framework (React, Vue, etc.), break down components into reusable parts (e.g., HeaderComponent, TrendChartComponent, InsightCardComponent).

Folder Structure Example:

/index.html

/css/styles.css

/js/main.js

/assets/ (for images and icons)
