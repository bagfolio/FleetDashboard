Revise the main dashboard layout to make it cleaner, more modern, and more focused on high-level operational insights, clear visual hierarchy, and real-time feedback.

1. HEADER
- Keep it minimal. Logo (left), Date (center), User icon (right).

2. SMART SUMMARY BOX (Below Header)
- Add a natural-language summary box like:
  "Fleet AI optimized 9 routes this week, saving 384 hrs and reducing 9,264 kg CO‚ÇÇ. 3 new AI recommendations. 1 maintenance alert."

3. KPI ROW
- Create 4 clean, white KPI cards:
  - Fuel Saved (gal)
  - Distance Reduced (mi)
  - Time Saved (hrs)
  - CO‚ÇÇ Reduced (kg)
- Each card: white background, green/blue number, small subtext (‚Äú‚Üë 8.7% since last month‚Äù).

4. IMPACT TRENDS CHART
- Use a modern, interactive multi-metric area or line chart.
- Metrics: Fuel Saved, Distance Reduced, Time Saved (separate lines, distinct colors).
- Add tooltips, filter buttons (Weekly / Monthly / Quarterly), and milestone flags (e.g. ‚Äú1000 gal milestone‚Äù).

5. OPERATIONAL FEED (ALERTS + INSIGHTS)
- Create a real-time feed of alerts/insights with:
  - White cards
  - Colored left border bar (Red = critical, Orange = warning, Blue = insight, Green = success)
  - Icons (e.g., üõ†, üöõ, ‚õΩ)
  - Brief text + "Take Action" link
  - Filters/tabs: All | Critical | Suggestions | Completed

6. LOWER METRIC MODULES (2-COLUMN CARD GRID)
- Create modular white cards with light shadows for:
  A. Recycling Marketplace
     - Items listed
     - Total value
     - Top material + current price
  B. Citizen Engagement
     - Reports submitted
     - Avg resolution time
     - Engagement score (progress bar)
  C. Carbon Credits
     - Credits earned
     - Available
     - Market value
     - Goal progress bar

7. BOTTOM SECTION ‚Äì FLEET OVERVIEW
- Replace static cards with:
  A. Interactive Table:
     - Columns: Vehicle ID | Status | Route | ETA | Completion | Actions
     - Color-coded chips (green = active, orange = delayed, blue = maintenance)
     - Sort and filter options
  OR
  B. Mini Map View:
     - Plot current fleet vehicle positions
     - Color-coded pins based on status
     - Click a vehicle to open a modal with live data

8. STYLING GUIDE
- Main background: white (#FFFFFF)
- Accent color: brand green (#28A745) only for success/CTAs
- Use soft shadows, 4‚Äì8px corner radius on cards
- Font: Open Sans / Roboto
- Headers: 24‚Äì32px, Body text: 14‚Äì16px

9. MAKE IT RESPONSIVE
- On mobile: stack KPI cards, stack trend chart + feed, collapsible fleet table

Goal: make the dashboard feel like a live control center with clear value, clean visuals, smart insights, and interactive fleet visibility.
